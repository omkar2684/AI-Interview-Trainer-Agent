# Interview Trainer Agent 🎯  

An **AI-powered Interview Trainer Agent** built for the IBM Hackathon.  
This project leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **IBM Cloud Lite services**,  
and the **IBM Granite foundation model** to help job seekers prepare effectively for interviews.  

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement  
Job seekers often struggle with interview preparation due to a lack of personalized guidance  
and role-specific practice. The Interview Trainer Agent addresses this by generating tailored  
interview question sets, model answers, and actionable feedback based on a user’s resume or job title.  

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution  
The agent retrieves role-specific questions, industry expectations, behavioral scenarios, and HR guidelines  
from recruitment portals, professional networks, and company databases. It provides targeted preparation  
covering both **technical** and **soft skills**, boosting user confidence and success rates in competitive hiring.
